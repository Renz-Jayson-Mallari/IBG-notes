JDK --> Java Development Kit. is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets.

SDK --> Software Development Kit. set of software development tools that allows the creation of application.

API --> Application Program Interface . is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software application.

Eclipse --> is a IDE --< Integrated Developement Environment >--  used in computer programming. Contains workspace and lots of plugins for customizing the environment.

System.out --> System is a class . out is a static member of System class.

Polymorphism --> ability of an object to take many forms.

Inheritance --> the process when a class aquired property (method or field) from another class.

Interface --> the way the user interact with computer.

Abstract class --> classes that contains abstracty methods.

Static variable --> variable that belongs to the class and NOT to the object.

Case/switch --> is a control flow of program execution via multi branch.

If / else --> is a control flow that when the if statement is true then the block of code inside the statement will be excuted and if false it will test the next statement. And execute if the condition is satisfy.

Boolean --> variable with tow possible value "true/false".

Int --> 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31-1.

Long --> 64-bit signed two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63-1

String --> In Java String are objects, and its used to create and manipulate strings.

main --> entry point in java. Whenever the program is called it will executes the main method first.

import --> allows our program to reffer to classes which are declared in other packages to be accessed without reffering to the full package name.

package --> A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer.

inner class --> a class inside of a class.

array --> collection of elements with the same type.

arraylist --> supports dynamic array that can grow as needed.

hashmap --> The HashMap class uses a hashtable to implement the Map interface. This allows the execution time of basic operations, such as get( ) and put( ), to remain constant even for large sets.

collections class -->  is an object that can hold references to other objects.

vector --> Vector implements a dynamic array.

hashset --> It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage.

Exception --> An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.

Console -->  is be used to get input from console. It provides methods to read texts and passwords.

Gargage collection -->  is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine which gets rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore. 

public --> A class, method, constructor, interface, etc. declared public can be accessed from any other class. ..
