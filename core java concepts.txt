core java concepts

Class --> A class is nothting but a blueprint or template for creating different object which defines its properties and behavior.

Method --> A method is a set code which is reffered by name and can be invoked(called) at any point in the program simply by utilizing the methods name.

Variable --> A variable is a container that holds the values that are used in Java programming.

Object --> An object is an instance of a class that has the state and behavior.
			state --> color,breed, name ************ behavior--> eating, walking, wagling the tail.

Javac --> The javac tools reads class and inrefaces definition written in the Java programming language, and compiles them into a bytecodes class files.

Bytecode --> Bytecode is a computer object code that is processed by a program, usually reffered to as a virtual machine, rather than by the "real" 
		computer machine, the hardware processor.

Jdk --> The Java Development Kit is a software development environment that is used for developing java application and applets.

applets --> is a small internet-based program written in java, a programming language for Web. Which can be downloaded at any computers.

SDK --> Software Development Kit is a developers tools that enables one to write a code with more ease, effectiveness and efficiency.
	--> It provides a lot of API that makes the programmer work's easy.
	
API --> An Application Programming Interface is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software application.

IDE --> Integrated Development Environment is a software application which enables the users to more easily write and debug Java programs.
	--> Many IDE provides features like syntax higlighting and code completion, which help the user to code more easily.
	
	
Ram --> Random Access Memory is a type of computer memory that can be access randomly. Means any bytes in the memory can be access without 
		the preceeding one. The most common type of memory that can be found in computers and other devices.

CPU --> Central Processing Unit is the brain of the computer where most calculations take place.

Interface --> An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to a class. It is a collection of abstract method. Along with the abstract methods, 
			an interface might also contains contants, default methods, static methods and nested types.

If/else --> if/else statement test a condition and execute the if/else block only if the condition is true.
 
Case/switch --> a switch statement is a type of selection control mechanism used to allow the value of variable or expression to change the control flow 
			of program execution via a multiway branch.

Try --> The TRY block contains a block of program statements within which an exception might occur.
    --> a try block is always followed by a catch block.
	
catch --> CATCH block handles the exception that occurs in associated TRY blocked.

finally block --> Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection, stream etc. 
			  --> Java finally block is always executed whether EXCEPTION is handled or not.
			  --> Java finally block always follows try or catch block.

Boolean --> The boolean value is one with two choices: true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0's.

Int --> the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.

Long --> The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer.

String --> String is nothing but a sequence of characters. In java, String is an immutable object which means it is constant and cannot be changed
          once it has been created.

Short --> the short data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
