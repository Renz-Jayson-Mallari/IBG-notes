do whatever it takes to deliver.
a-- ask question
b-- source answer

ex.
String data type
"1234" + " + " + "99"

Integers data type
operators + - * / %
% -- modulo
modulo is the remainder of the given operation.

Java Math Library --- read the documentation
ex.
Math.sin()
Math.log()
Math.sqrt()
Math.min()

Integer opration

1234 + 99 = 1333
1234 * 99 = 122166
1234 / 99 = 12
