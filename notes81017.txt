no company cares how do you get the answer
we are here to deliver solution within the timeframe.

there resources out there to train yourself.

we r about creating great engineer.

 WHEN you get more complex problem... 

break it down into smaller simnple task as possible
ask all the question needed to solve it

Piazza is for tech talk---> to answer that you cant solve.

stay engage in piazza help each outer out.
asking question is a great thing
not asking question is scary thing


company is more concern on how you solve the problem 
you get better by jumping and jumping
